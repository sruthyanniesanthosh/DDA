# DDA_examples
## Distributed Data Computing and analytics Mini Project

In this mini project, I experimented and implemented various Distributed Computing concepts like:

(1) Distributed Computing using MPI concepts (MPI4PY)- Kmeans, KNN, Matrix operations, Text mining and classification
(2) Tensor Flow
(3) Apache Spark (PySpark)
(4) Hadoop
(5) PyTorch, Tensorflow
(6) Machine Learning Algorithms for Distributed Computing
